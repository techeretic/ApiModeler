# ApiModeler
This just a fun project while I'm working from home. I wanted to try out some of the new libraries and updates from Google.

I will be attempting to use the following libraries/patterns/etc.
- Moshi
- Couroutines
- Dynamic delivery
- Jetpack
- Motion Layout

Currently fetching data from

Feel free to leave any feedback
